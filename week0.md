Before starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is setup with the
appropriate software (detailed below).    
In addition, online learning requires extra screen 'real estate' 
and you may find it useful (but not essential) to have a dual screen setup or two devices e.g. laptop & phone.    
If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact one of the trainers for help.    

### Setup instructions (Adapted from Data Carpentry course materials https://datacarpentry.org ).  

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install the
**`tidyverse`** package from within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
**`tidyverse`**.

#### Windows

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
  which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### macOS

##### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open RStudio, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.
* To check the version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of R you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of R you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it.

##### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest R version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install R
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install RStudio
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.
* Go to the
  [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


#### For everyone

**After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the `tidyverse` packages.**

* After starting RStudio, at the console type:
  `install.packages("tidyverse")`

* You can also do this by going to Tools -> Install Packages and typing the names of the packages separated by a comma.
