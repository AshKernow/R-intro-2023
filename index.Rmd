# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within CRUK CI for interacting with, analyzing and visualizing
cancer biology datasets.

In this training course, we aim to provide a friendly introduction to R pitched
at a beginners level but also for those who have been on R training courses
previously and would like a refresher or to consolidate their skills.

The course will be run over **6 weeks** with the following structure:

* **Online lesson each Monday at 11am** lasting 45 minutes via a video call in Microsoft Teams
    * the instructor will share his/her screen featuring an RStudio window during this call
    * this will be recorded for those who weren’t able to join the meeting or so you can replay the lesson
* More **in-depth material** covering the concepts introduced on the Monday lesson to go through in your own time
* A **weekly assignment** consisting of exercises to practice some of the concepts covered in that and previous weeks' lessons
* An **online recap session each Friday at 11am** to go through the assignment and answer any questions you may have
    * again this is expected to last around 45 minutes via a video call in Microsoft Teams
 
The first lesson will be on Tuesday 14 April, not the Easter Monday bank
holiday, and thereafter every Monday for the following 5 weeks. Similarly we
will run the Friday recap for the week of 4 – 8 May on the Thursday instead as
8 May is the special VE Day bank holiday.

We will be using Microsoft Teams in running this course and members of the
Bioinformatics Core will be available during the course for 1:1 support using
chats and calls within Teams.

    * reading in a data set

    * handling missing values

    * selecting and filtering subsets of interest

    * creating plots

    * generating summary statistics
