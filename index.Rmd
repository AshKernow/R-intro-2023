# Introduction

This site contains the materials for an R course.

# Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** for
interacting with, analyzing and visualizing data.

In this training course, we aim to provide a friendly introduction to R pitched
at a beginners level but also for those who have been on R training courses
previously and would like a refresher or to consolidate their skills.
