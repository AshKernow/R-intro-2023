### Description

**R** is one of the leading programming languages in **Data Science** and the
most widely used within CRUK CI for interacting with, analyzing and visualizing
cancer biology datasets.

In this training course, we aim to provide a friendly introduction to R pitched
at a beginners level but also for those who have been on R training courses
previously and would like a refresher or to consolidate their skills.
